<h3>Welcome to the EscapeCharacters Project Website<br>
</h3>
We are currently working on the android application dubbed, 'What's
Happenin', in the Software Engineering course (CS330), over the course
of the Fall 2012 semester.&nbsp; This mobile application is envisioned
to be a social media hub of the CSB/SJU and St. Joe community.&nbsp;
Looking for something to do on a Friday night at SJU?&nbsp; Want to
know 'what's happenin' in St. Joe?&nbsp; What's 'hoppin' at CSB?&nbsp;
Then this is the app for you.&nbsp; It will bring together the big hit
attractions of these three communities into one location, and tell you
what's 'hot' and what's 'not'.<br>
<br>
Aside from providing an easy method available at the tips of your
fingers to find a way to make your boring life more interesting, you
can also rate, comment, and check-in to different locations and events
on campus or in town.&nbsp; Let everyone else know what is going on,
what to hit up, and what to avoid.&nbsp; <span
style="font-weight: bold;">Not only can you see what is happening
around the CSB/SJU community, but you can also add to everyone's
experience by introducing your own parties, events, and happenin's!<br>
<br>
